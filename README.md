White Industries is a machining company for billet aluminum bicycle components located in Petaluma CA. 
In order to meet growing demand, they hired me to create a pneumatic auto door that could be mounted to all of their machines (routers and lathes).
The company did not have any engineers as employees so I was the engineer and manager of the project.
In 2.5 months I designed, built, and tested a fully functional autodoor that meet all the necessary requirements:
1 Controlled by the host machine through ladder code
2 Scalable 
3 Safety (by using a Banner light curtain)
4 Documented so that the other employees could troubleshoot, maintain, and adapt the autodoor to other machines.
Please see the video demonstration for the final product.

It was abundantly fun and I am very thankful for the opportunity.
